Midterm Project
================

This is a midterm project intending to analyze the weight of three pet
dogs. Now, I’m going to import the data, tidy, and clean the data.

``` r
weight_data = 
  read_excel("./data/dogweights_07sept2020 (1).xlsx", range = "B2:F207",
             col_types = c("date", "guess", "guess", "guess", "guess")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(date) %>%
  subset(raisin != "NA" | simone != "NA" | gagne != "NA") %>%
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    raisin:gagne,
    names_to = "name",
    values_to = "weight"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    weight = str_replace(weight, "1810", "18 10"),
    weight = str_replace(weight, "1803", "18 03")
  ) %>%
  separate(weight, into = c("pound", "ounce"), sep = " ") %>%
  separate(std, into = c("std_pound", "std_ounce"), sep = " ") %>%
  mutate(
    pound = as.numeric(pound),
    ounce = as.numeric(ounce),
    weight = pound + ounce / 16,
    std_pound = as.numeric(std_pound),
    std_ounce = as.numeric(std_ounce),
    std = std_pound + std_ounce / 16
  ) %>%
  select(year, month, day, name, weight, std)
```

The raw data is in excel format and the “Date” variable has multiple
forms of expressions, so when importing it, I unify them in a single
form of expression.

Then, I unify the expressions of the names of columns and drop rows that
has no date information as well as rows that has NA in all three dogs’
weight. Since there is only one row that has no date entry, and rows
that has no weight record for all three dogs are useless, this removal
has trivial impact on our later analysis.

I separate the date into year, month, and day for a better view.
Noticing that the raw data is in a wide format where all three pets’
names are the column names which is not tidy, I make it into a long
format. I also convert the weight unit into solely “pounds”, replacing
the confusing format of two numbers(pounds and ounces) in the raw data.
Finally, I rearrange the columns to present information for a more
understanding view.

Now, create a second data frame containing notes in the raw data and
save the two data frames into csv files.

``` r
note_data = 
  read_excel("./data/dogweights_07sept2020 (1).xlsx", range = "B2:G207",
             col_types = c("date", "guess", "guess", "guess", "guess", "guess")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(-c(raisin, simone, gagne, std)) %>%
  rename(note = x6) %>%
  drop_na(note) %>%
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-")
```

    ## Warning in read_fun(path = enc2native(normalizePath(path)), sheet_i = sheet, :
    ## Expecting date in B79 / R79C2: got 's'

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...6

``` r
write_csv(weight_data, "./data/tidy_weights.csv")
write_csv(note_data, "./data/tidy_notes.csv")
```

In the tidy dataset containing weights, there are totally 603 rows and
each row is a weight information for a single dog in a single day.
Columns include variables of the date, name, weight(pounds), and the
weight of a standard object. There are 201 unique dates included.
Following is a table showing the number of observations for each dog,
along with their average weight and standard deviation.

``` r
weight_data %>%
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(
    num = sum(!is.na(weight)),
    avg_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = T),
    sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm = T)
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 4
    ##   name     num avg_weight sd_weight
    ##   <chr>  <int>      <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 gagne    119       10.3     0.708
    ## 2 raisin   201       18.2     0.980
    ## 3 simone   192       10.4     0.384
